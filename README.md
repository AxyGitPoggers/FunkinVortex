# FunkinVortex
Arrow Editor made for friday night funkin, inspired by Arrow Vortex

You can download this from the actions tab. You have to be signed in and then
1. Click actions
2. Click latest build with a checkmark
3. Scroll down and click on your os's file

Usage:
Keys 1-8 Place notes, and if you hold control while pressing a button and a note is there, it selects it.
Moving the strumline with Up Arrow and Down Arrow while selecting a note sets its sustain. You hit escape to stop selecting.
On the right there is also a menu which includes all the data shit, which works basically the same as base game one. You have to select 
it to edit notes (duh)

You can also hit the right/left arrow keys to edit the snap. This determines where you can move your strumline. The Q key cycles the note types.
Current Supported notes are: Normal, Lift, Mine, Death. Drain is planned to be added, and is already added to modding plus code. 

Hit Space to play (which probably crashes if no audio is loaded)

One difference is that it includes all notes at the same time. This lags a bit but i think it helps visualize sustains better and shit.
